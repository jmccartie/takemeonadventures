Welcome to Take Me On Adventures!

This blog was born out of my love of being a dad. Iâ€™ve been blessed with an amazing wife and 3 beautiful kids. I consider it one of my duties to enjoy every bit of our crazy lives and bring my family along for the ride. Sometimes, this means long backpacking trips or long drives out in the country with no destination. Other times, it means making forts out of sheets in the living room, complete with pirates, princesses, and tickle monsters. But each day is something new, and each day is something to be treasured.

We hope the words we share here encourage you to begin to see your role of a parent as one with limitless possibilities. Parenting is hard, but together we can make it an adventure!
