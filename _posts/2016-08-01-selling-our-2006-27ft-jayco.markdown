With the purchase of our new home in North Idaho, it's time to downsize our travel options. It'll be sad to see our tiny home leave, but it's the right thing to do.

But that means, you (or someone you know?) is about to purchase an awesomely updated, boondocking-ready, home on the road!

Here's the post:

We're the second owners of this awesome travel trailer. We purchased it from the original owner last October and have lovingly updated it to be a boondocker's dream. It's a fantastic trailer for a small family that wants to get outside and explore. We’ve recently bought a house and are done with our travels for now. We’re hoping to sell “Chloe” to a great family who loves the outdoors.

The original owner took great care of this trailer and used it infrequently for short trips. All of the systems worked great, but we wanted to update its look. New paint, cushion covers, dark wood laminate flooring, upgraded premium mattress, and new counter-tops. You can see these upgrades here: [http://www.takemeonadventures.com/2015/11/10/rv-remodel.html](http://www.takemeonadventures.com/2015/11/10/rv-remodel.html) These upgrades cost us about $2,000.

After spending 2 months in it with 3 kids, we decided the kids needed more storage and more space to place inside (*not* at the dinette).  We removed the front queen and replaced with 3 twin beds. The top bunk bed in rear has been removed and replaced with temporary storage.  You can view these upgrades here:  [http://www.takemeonadventures.com/2016/02/02/bedroom-remodel.html](http://www.takemeonadventures.com/2016/02/02/bedroom-remodel.html)

In order to be completely self-sustained, we also made the following upgrades:

* Replaced all light bulbs with LED's ($30)
* Installed two new 12v socket panels (phone charging off DC, $30)
* Replaced single deep cycle battery with 2 6V golf cart batteries (giving us 220 amp hours at 12v, $300)
* Installed 3 100 watt Renogy solar panels with tilt bars. ($500)
* Renogy MPPT 40 amp charge controller ($200)
* We removed the microwave. Being on solar power, we never used it, so removing it gave us more cabinet storage.
* Nature's Head composting toilet. This was a hefty investment but worth every penny as it allows us to camp wherever we want without worrying about dumping black tanks. If you're not interested in using it, we'll remove it and provide a credit for an RV toilet (the black tank is still functional) * ($950)
* Trimetric battery monitor. This has proved far more useful than the Renogy MT-5 tracer. The Trimetric uses a shunt and allows us to accurately monitor battery draw. ($150)
* Magnum 600w inverter. I originally ran a single line of romex into the kitchen to power kitchen appliances. I then decided to hard-wire an extension cable to the inverter, allowing us to power all AC outlets using the shore power cable. The romex is still installed if you wish to revert this.  ($480)
* Upgraded AC->DC converter to Powermax 35amp for use with generator. ($120)
* Wired all electrical onto panel in front storage area. This includes two bus bars and disconnects for both the solar system and the main batteries.
* We replaced the scary old (and heavy!) couch with a palette couch we built ourselves. ($100 … in cushions)

All told, the above upgrades were about $2,800 (not including labor)

In addition, this trailer is set up for cell-service boosting so you can work from anywhere!

* weBoost Drive 4G-M booster ($380)
* Wilson Wide-Band Yagi directional antenna ($80)
* SureCall Full Band Outdoor Omni 3G/4G Antenna ($60)
* RCA 30 mile HDTV antenna ($50)


Known issues

* Small tear (~6in) in roof covering. Patched with EternaBond and sealed.
* Small dents in rear exterior paneling
* The awning is starting to show its age and should be replaced soon. Still works fine, but has a few small tears and one of the arms is missing a part to keep it locked down (I just stake it into the ground, which is better anyways)
* Black tent vent cover on roof broken. Since not being used with black tank, covered with EternaBond.
* My trim work isn’t professional so there are a few bad cuts to the quarter-round in some places.
