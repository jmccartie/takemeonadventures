With the purchase of our new home in North Idaho, it's time to downsize our travel options. It'll be sad to see our tiny home leave, but it's the right thing to do.

But that means, you (or someone you know?) is about to purchase an awesomely updated, boondocking-ready, home on the road!

** UPDATE: Sold! **
