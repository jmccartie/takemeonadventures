<p>We had a blast this past weekend at the 2nd Annual “Wiggle Out Loud” Family Music Festival here in Oklahoma City. We were downtown grabbing lunch as a family when I remembered that the festival was happening just a few blocks away!</p><p>We drove over to find a ton of kid-friendly booths, food trucks, a splash pad, and a live music stage with family-friendly music.</p><!-- more -->
<p>Our first stop was the “Backstage Pass” booth where Ruby (complete in floral skirt and Cinderella cowgirl boots) created a backstage pass and wristband.</p>

<p>Next door was a booth where the kids were able to create their own shaker. Quite an ingenious idea — a plastic Easter egg filled with dry beans, two spoons and some colorful tape to hold it all together. I tried to teach the girls about maracas, but Henry decided he just wanted to use one as a rattle.</p>

<p>Those booths were great, but they didn’t hold a candle to the “Garage Band” booth put on by our local music college (UCO). They’d set up drums, an electric bass, guitar, keyboard, and a microphone. Kids took turns trying their luck at each instrument. It was all kinds of chaos, but I had fun helping Ruby bust out a beat.</p>

<p>I couldn’t convince Ava to get on the microphone, but she’s seen me play guitar plenty at home, so she was pretty amicable to sitting down with the electric guitar.</p>

<p>Thanks to everyone at Wiggle Out Loud for putting on such a great event!</p>
