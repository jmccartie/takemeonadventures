<p>Let’s catch you up on the last few weeks&hellip;</p><ul><li>We left OKC on March 28th an drove to Western Oklahoma (Sayre).</li>
<li>Then to Amarillo, TX. While not the prettiest of towns, it allowed us time to complete our change of residency to Texas by getting our driver&rsquo;s licenses.</li>
<li>We got out first &ldquo;down time&rdquo; by camping in Eastern New Mexico in Santa Rosa. The State Park was beautiful and it was a welcome change from cramped RV parks.</li>
<li>Albuquerque was next. It was great to see our friends at one of the newer <a href="http://www.lifechurch.tv">LifeChurch.tv</a> campuses in Rio Rancho, NM. The museums downtown were great, but we found ourselves over-extending ourselves too much and getting stressed out.</li>
<li>Santa Fe was a bit more our pace. But once again, we tried to do too much and found ourselves frustrated by cranky kids and crowded RV parks.</li>
<li>Taos, NM was awesome. And cold. And windy. But awesome. We stayed at a <a href="http://www.rvparkreviews.com/regions/new-mexico/taos/taos-monte-bello-rv-park">small RV park</a> with only a few other trailers. We finally got into a bit of a work/life rhythm between myself, Erin, and the kids. We did less and began to really enjoy our time together.</li>
</ul><p>&hellip;but we needed to get out of town. RV parks are fine (running water and electricity are great!), but I really wanted us to try our hand at &ldquo;dry camping&rdquo; (or boondocking) &ndash; no hookups, and preferably on some public lands. We&rsquo;re still dealing with the financial burden of selling our house (delays, termites, etc), so the idea of staying somewhere for free sounded especially nice. :)</p>

<p>For months, I&rsquo;ve been researching what it would take to live off the grid for a few days. While I&rsquo;ve camped for longer stints, trying to think through all the details of keeping 5 people fed, warm, and (kinda) clean was a little daunting.</p><p>3 days before we were to leave Taos and head up into the mountains, I finally decided to check out our battery and solar setup. Until now, I had completely forgotten about the fact that I was <i>pretty sure</i> I had completely run down our deep-cycle RV/Marine battery while Cora the Caravan was in storage. I unplugged us from shore power and &hellip; nothing worked. Crap. I had plans to upgrade us to two, 6V deep cycle golf cart batteries, but wasn&rsquo;t planning on it so soon. Thankfully, the local Napa Parts store could overnight me a pair from Albuquerque. $360 later (oof!), I brought them home, and got them loaded in and wired up.</p><p>The solar panel I had purchased &ndash; <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00HR8YNK6/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B00HR8YNK6&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=mccblo-20&amp;linkId=63NW2BYMDYCGNDZC">a cool little 100W Renogy briefcase setup</a> &ndash; was next. I got it out from its hiding place behind our couch. I plugged it into the batteries and &hellip; nothing happened. Thankfully, I discovered the Renogy people have <i>awesome</i> customer service. The guy on the phone walked me through a few troubleshooting steps and we got it fired up.</p><p>The next day, I walked into our bathroom and into a puddle of water. The cold temps in Taos put some extra pressure on our water lines and we were leaking from beneath the sink. I unscrewed some panels to find a complicated web of water lines leading to 1) our outside shower, 2) the bathroom sink, 3) the shower, and 4) the toilet. I spent all day Friday researching how to fix the leak, running into town to buy parts, and hunched over the toilet with a headlamp trying to get the water to stop.</p><p>Ok, can we go camping yet?!</p><p>We picked out a <a href="http://freecampsites.net/#!2243&amp;query=sitedetails">spot from freecampsites.net</a> and had given it a little scout-out a few days ahead of time to make sure we could fit. We filled our water tanks, and even filled up 3 extra, 6-gallon jugs to take along. We turned off the road and onto a short gravel road. As we pulled our trailer into the meadow and got un-hitched, I turned to Erin and we both smiled big. It was quiet, beautiful, and our kids could roam around without getting hit by a car or getting lured into a windowless van. This is exactly what we had been waiting for.

We’ll head East this weekend for more dry camping and a visit to <a href="http://www.nps.gov/grsa/index.htm">Great Sand Dunes National Park</a>!</p>
