<p>Not every adventure has to be extravagant. Now, don’t get me wrong — I love to plan out big fun trips, or spontaneous adventures on the other side of town. But we can’t all spend a few hundred dollars every weekend to have fun with our family. To that end, I always try to find cheap and easy ways to get outside and connect with my kids.</p>
<p>This week’s weekend fun? Disc golf. I started playing when we used to live in San Francisco. I’d barely call it a sport — more like a skill sport like golf. Except I don’t get insanely angry playing disc golf. And I don’t spend $40-60 a round, either.</p><!-- more -->
<p>Head over to your local sports store and buy a disc. Just one will do at first.  Then, enjoy the walk!</p>
<p>I started by taking my kids for a walk, but I brought my discs along. We have a short 9-hole course at the college close to our house. The first time out, I just let the kids walk with me. But our oldest quickly wanted to learn how to play. I spent $10 on her own disc and now she loves playing with me.</p>
<p>We’re both pretty terrible, but we love getting outdoors together. And more importantly, the hour that we play gives us plenty of time to talk and plenty of teachable moments. So go spend $10 on a disc and get outside with your kids. Just don’t play any courses with water … because you’ve only got one disc. :)</p>
