<p>A few months back, I took Ava on a daddy-daughter adventure. I knew the trip would involve a few miles of hiking and didn’t think Ruby (3 1/2 at the time) would be able to swing it. As Ava and I pulled out of the drive way that day, I remembered seeing Ruby standing in the garage with tears in her eyes. But I promised her I’d make it up to her — an adventure just for the two of us.</p>
<p>But summer showed up the following weekend, and my desire for camping went into hibernation. That is, until this past week. We woke up Friday morning to temperatures in the 50’s (down from mid-90’s the week before). I woke up with a spring in my step: fall was here! I spent the day in the backyard with the girls, mowing the lawn, trimming trees, and prepping for the pool to be closed down for the season. As the day started to wind down, little Ruby (now a 4-year-old) politely asked, “Daddy, can we go camping tonight?”</p><!-- more -->
<p>I remembered the promise I made her back in June and my eyes got wide with excitement. “Yeah! Let’s do it!”</p>
<h2>Scared of the Dark</h2>
<p>So after dinner, I sent Ruby to get her pajamas on, while I pulled the tent out of the garage. Ruby helped me bring out a pile of blankets to the tent. She then ran back inside to get her most prized possessions: “Bear bear and blanky.”  We went back inside to say goodnight to everyone. Her big sister Ava leaned over and whispered, “You’re going to have so much fun tonight, Ruby!”  Ruby smiled back. We made our way to the tent, climbed in, and closed the tent zippers. We laid there in the dark, listening to the crickets, cicadas, and a far off train.</p>
<p>“Daddy, I’m scared.”</p>
<p>“Scared of what?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know,” she said.</p>
<p>I tried to laugh it off. I told her about the moon and stars. I told her about cicadas and how they would be going away soon. All this to try and distract her from any irrational fears she had. I don’t remember Ava ever being afraid of camping out. And if she had, I don’t think Ava ever had an option of going inside: most of her early campouts were far out in the woods where there was no option but to fall asleep.</p>
<p>Thirty minutes later and Ruby had had enough. “Daddy, I want to go sleep inside.”  My first instinct was to get frustrated. I had spent time and energy setting everything up and also wanted Ruby to face her fears and get used to sleeping outside. But at the same time, I don’t ever want to force my kids to do something they’re not comfortable with. I had come to a similar conclusion one time with Ava while I was teaching her how to rock climb. She suddenly became terrified of an easy roped climb that she was more than capable of. But I never want my kids to look back on their times with me and feel like I forced them. I’ll always encourage them and try to convince them they’re capable of more than they think — but I’ll never force them.</p>
<p>“Of course you can go inside, honey.”  Ruby giggled a little, grabbed her bear-bear and blanky and ran inside to sleep with her mom. And Ava, seizing the opportunity, grabbed her blank and ran outside to the tent.</p>
<p>“Can I sleep outside with you?” she asked.</p>
<p>“Of course you can!” I responded.</p>
<p>Ruby: thanks for staying up with me last night. I loved our time in the tent together. Looking forward to many more adventures together this fall. You’re a beautiful little girl with a fun spirit. I love you, little girl.</p>
<h2>What About You?</h2>
<p>Have you ever camped out with your kids? How old were they when you first took them camping?</p>
