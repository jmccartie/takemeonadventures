My name is Jon McCartie. I live with my wife Erin, my two daughters, and one son. This is our blog about parenting … and how we’re working to make it an adventure we love.

We don’t pretend to be perfect parents…not by any means. But what we learn, we hope to share with you. We hope you’ll laugh, cry, and be inspired by reading what we share.

Here is great place to get started. For interviews, media requests, or general questions, contact us at takemeonadventures@gmail.com.
